I provide leadership, technical expertise, knowledge, and experience in applying modern software engineering methods to computational science and engineering (CSE) problems for a variety of large, complex CSE projects. I leverage my background in chemical engineering, applied math, large-scale nonlinear programming, software development, software integration, software engineering best-practices, and over 20 years of doing numerical algorithm and software development and software engineering on large and small computational science and engineering projects. My more recent interests focus on software engineering processes and workflows for creating individual packages of sustainable software and sustainable ecosystems of packages shared among large distributed teams of developers over long periods of time.
